FirstRun

Publishing to github for reference. A list of my first few .NET applications that helped me learn.

EkZ3KUtE: This program was supposed to be a UI for housing my ProgHasher functionalities and making it look like either "Launchy" or "Everything". Unfortunately, I left the UI for later so it's still in my repository just in case I come back to it.

Number Conversion: Converts number to various bases. My first attempt at Forms.
Picto Vi3w3r: A picture viewer application. Another attempt at complex forms from which I learnt a lot.
